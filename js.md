# Control flow
    the order in which computers execute statements in a script.

example:
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}

Conditional loops change the structure of the control flow.

# Expressions and operators

# Operators
- #### Assignment operators
    assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. looks like this, x = y. Asigning the value of y to x.

    - Return value and chaining retrieving/return x = y value.
    const z = (x = y); // Or equivalently: const z = x = y;
    console.log(z); // Log the return value of the assignment x = y.
    console.log(x = y); // Or log the return value directly.
    - logical assignments, (a + x = y). Chaining these expression, each assignment is evaluated right-to-left.
